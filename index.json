With increases in biotic disturbance activity, an emerging ecological phenomenon has been documented: biotic disturbance ‘hotspots', or areas where two or more biotic disturbance agents co-occur in space and time. Biotic disturbance hotspots may have important implications for forest resilience, particularly if they erode mechanisms of post-disturbance forest recovery. The factors leading to hotspot occurrence, however, remain poorly understood. We characterized the patterns and drivers of biotic disturbance hotspots occurring from 2000 to 2020 across three broad forested regions in the western United States (US; the Southern Rockies, Middle Rockies, and Cascades). Using Bayesian spatio-temporal models, we evaluated whether hotspots can be predicted from predisposing factors expected to increase forest susceptibility to biotic disturbance (i.e. forest composition, topography, and average climate), as well as inciting factors known to trigger individual bark beetle and pathogen outbreaks (i.e. annual weather). Biotic disturbance hotspots exhibited distinct spatio-temporal patterns and trends within each region. Forest structure and composition were the strongest and most consistent drivers of hotspots. Other factors varied in their importance by region, reflecting regional differences in biophysical context. Relative to the predictor variables included in our models, estimated spatio-temporal random effects were more closely correlated with model predictions, suggesting that dynamic factors such as outbreak spread strongly shape patterns of biotic disturbance hotspots. Our results illustrate the widespread nature of biotic disturbance hotspots across western US coniferous forests and demonstrate the importance of forest structure and regional outbreak dynamics in anticipating hotspots at regional scales. These findings provide a deeper understanding of interacting forest disturbances and have important implications for the resilience of forests during a period marked by continued increases in disturbance activity.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Patterns and drivers of biotic disturbance hotspots in western United States coniferous forests","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michele S.

Because spatial patterns of burn severity are influenced by a complex mixture of drivers, they remain difficult to predict for any given burned landscape. At broader extents, however, spatial scaling relationships relating high-severity patch size and shape to overall fire size, when combined with scenarios regarding regional area burned and fire-size distributions, offer a means to anticipate the spatial configuration of burn severity in future fires. Here, leveraging a satellite burn severity dataset for 1,615 fire events occurring across the northwest United States (US) between 1985 and 2020, we present an approach for simulating expected patch-level burn severity patterns at the scale of a region or fire regime of interest. We demonstrate this approach in a historically climate-limited fire regime within the Pacific Northwest, US, where relatively infrequent but large and severe fires shape biomass-rich forests, and where fire potential is projected to increase as summer fire seasons become warmer and drier. We quantify how, for a given total burned area, the range of cumulative burn severity patterns is expected to vary with the size distributions of fire events. Our results illustrate how shifts in fire-size distributions towards larger fire events will lead to increasingly large high-severity burn patches with interior areas that are increasingly far from unburned seed sources following fire. In contrast, the same total area burned in more numerous but smaller fire events will result in qualitatively different cumulative patterns of burn severity, characterized by smaller high-severity patches and closer proximity to post-fire seed sources across burned landscapes. These results have important implications in forested regions, informing management actions ranging from pre-fire planning (e.g., fire response preparedness) to real-time decision-making (e.g., fire suppression versus managed wildfire use) and post-fire responses (e.g., replanting to restore tree cover and/or promoting early-seral habitat). The approach we present is generalizable and can be applied across regions and fire regimes to anticipate potential future fire effects.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Few large or many small fires: Using spatial scaling of severe fire to quantify effects of fire-size distribution shifts","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"As climate change alters freshwater, estuarine, and marine habitats, Pacific salmon need increasing levels of conservation action to maintain population health.

Spatial patterns of area burned at high severity strongly shape forest resilience and constitute a key dimension of fire regimes, yet remain difficult to predict.

Using 1615 fires occurring across the Northwest United States between 1985 and 2020, we evaluated scaling relationships within fire regimes and tested whether relationships vary across space and time. Patterns of high-severity fire demonstrate consistent scaling behaviour; as fire size increases, high-severity patches consistently increase in size and homogeneity.

Outbreaks of native bark beetles (Curculionidae: Scolytinae) are key natural disturbances that shape the structure and function of conifer forests across the northern hemisphere. While drivers of bark beetle outbreaks have been studied extensively at spatial scales ranging from stands to continents, within‐stand processes governing individual tree mortality in an outbreak are less well understood. Here, we use a spatially explicit long‐term monitoring dataset of a lodgepole pine (*Pinus contorta* var. *latifolia*) forest (\u003e9000 individually mapped trees in three 2‐ha plots) impacted by a severe mountain pine beetle (*Dendroctonus ponderosae*) outbreak to explore interactions among fine scale drivers of beetle‐caused tree mortality. Using a Bayesian spatial modeling approach, we evaluated how tree scale and tree neighborhood scale characteristics interact with tree size to mediate host tree susceptibility to mountain pine beetle outbreak in the Southern Rocky Mountains (USA). We found evidence that both tree growth rate preceding the outbreak and neighborhood structure (within a 10 meter radius of the host tree) mediate the effect of tree size, and that the direction and magnitude of these mediating effects vary with tree size. Tree scale mortality probability increased with pre‐outbreak growth rate for small to medium sized host trees (~10–25 cm diameter), but that same effect was not detected for large trees. Conversely, tree scale mortality probability increased with greater neighborhood density, with the most pronounced effects for medium to large sized host trees (~15–30 cm diameter). Within‐stand topographic variability was not an important predictor of mortality probability; among stands, however, the stand in the driest topographic position experienced the greatest overall mortality.
