Because spatial patterns of burn severity are influenced by a complex mixture of drivers, they remain difficult to predict for any given burned landscape. At broader extents, however, spatial scaling relationships relating high-severity patch size and shape to overall fire size, when combined with scenarios regarding regional area burned and fire-size distributions, offer a means to anticipate the spatial configuration of burn severity in future fires. Here, leveraging a satellite burn severity dataset for 1,615 fire events occurring across the northwest United States (US) between 1985 and 2020, we present an approach for simulating expected patch-level burn severity patterns at the scale of a region or fire regime of interest. We demonstrate this approach in a historically climate-limited fire regime within the Pacific Northwest, US, where relatively infrequent but large and severe fires shape biomass-rich forests, and where fire potential is projected to increase as summer fire seasons become warmer and drier. We quantify how, for a given total burned area, the range of cumulative burn severity patterns is expected to vary with the size distributions of fire events. Our results illustrate how shifts in fire-size distributions towards larger fire events will lead to increasingly large high-severity burn patches with interior areas that are increasingly far from unburned seed sources following fire. In contrast, the same total area burned in more numerous but smaller fire events will result in qualitatively different cumulative patterns of burn severity, characterized by smaller high-severity patches and closer proximity to post-fire seed sources across burned landscapes. These results have important implications in forested regions, informing management actions ranging from pre-fire planning (e.g., fire response preparedness) to real-time decision-making (e.g., fire suppression versus managed wildfire use) and post-fire responses (e.g., replanting to restore tree cover and/or promoting early-seral habitat). The approach we present is generalizable and can be applied across regions and fire regimes to anticipate potential future fire effects.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Few large or many small fires: Using spatial scaling of severe fire to quantify effects of fire-size distribution shifts","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Salmon populations are in currently in crisis across the West, and environmental conditions are likely to pose even more challenges in the future as climate change warms waters in our streams and oceans.

In coastal forests of the Pacific Northwest, salmon spawning habitat is embedded within one of the most productive, biomass-rich forest ecosystems in the world.

However, we lack an understanding of the relative impact that forest management actions aimed at restoring forest structural complexity can achieve towards the long term population resilience of Pacific salmon populations in the context of climate change. In this project, we are addressing this challenge using an integrated population model for chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) in the Willapa basin (southwest Washington, USA).

Spatial patterns of area burned at high severity strongly shape forest resilience and constitute a key dimension of fire regimes, yet remain difficult to predict. To characterize the range of burn severity patterns expected within contemporary fire regimes, we quantified scaling relationships relating fire size to patterns of burn severity. Using 1615 fires occurring across the Northwest United States between 1985 and 2020, we evaluated scaling relationships within fire regimes and tested whether relationships vary across space and time. Patterns of high-severity fire demonstrate consistent scaling behaviour; as fire size increases, high-severity patches consistently increase in size and homogeneity.

However, the role of fine-scale spatial heterogeneity in shaping compensatory growth responses is poorly understood for many broad-scale disturbances.\\\n*Objectives* \\\nWe quantified how fine-scale spatial structure affects individual and aggregate tree growth leading up to and following a severe mountain pine beetle (MPB; *Dendroctonus ponderosae*) outbreak. We asked: (1) How does individual tree growth vary with tree- and neighborhood-scale characteristics? (2) How do within-stand aggregate growth and overstory recruitment vary with neighborhood-scale characteristics?\\\n*Methods* \\\nWe used a spatially explicit long-term monitoring dataset of a subalpine lodgepole pine (*Pinus contorta* var. *latifolia*) forest (in Colorado, USA) in which every tree ≥ 5 cm diameter was measured and mapped prior to (1989, 2004) and following (2018) a severe MPB outbreak (2003–2011). We used spatial regression to characterize drivers of growth.\\\n*Results*\\\nOverall, we found strong evidence for post-outbreak compensatory responses across spatial scales. Neighborhood characteristics shaped both individual and aggregate growth, with the magnitude of growth strongly mediated by pre-outbreak neighborhood structure and neighborhood mortality. Variation in tree-scale growth, combined with the spatial arrangement of surviving trees, resulted in highly variable emergent patterns of aggregate growth and recruitment. \\\n*Conclusions*\\\nOur findings highlight the importance of fine-scale landscape configuration in shaping forest resilience. Quantifying compensatory responses in a spatially explicit framework at different scales is critical for modeling post-disturbance forest dynamics, which is increasingly important as climate warms and forest disturbance regimes change.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Fine‑scale spatial heterogeneity shapes compensatory responses of a subalpine forest to severe bark beetle outbreak","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"West of the Cascade Crest in Washington and Oregon (\u0026ldquo;northwestern Cascadia\u0026rdquo;), wildfire has historically been infrequent yet severe, occurring at intervals ranging from one to several centuries, with fire events possibly as large as one million hectares characterized by high levels of tree mortality.

Outbreaks of native bark beetles (Curculionidae: Scolytinae) are key natural disturbances that shape the structure and function of conifer forests across the northern hemisphere. While drivers of bark beetle outbreaks have been studied extensively at spatial scales ranging from stands to continents, within‐stand processes governing individual tree mortality in an outbreak are less well understood. Here, we use a spatially explicit long‐term monitoring dataset of a lodgepole pine (*Pinus contorta* var. *latifolia*) forest (\u003e9000 individually mapped trees in three 2‐ha plots) impacted by a severe mountain pine beetle (*Dendroctonus ponderosae*) outbreak to explore interactions among fine scale drivers of beetle‐caused tree mortality. Using a Bayesian spatial modeling approach, we evaluated how tree scale and tree neighborhood scale characteristics interact with tree size to mediate host tree susceptibility to mountain pine beetle outbreak in the Southern Rocky Mountains (USA). We found evidence that both tree growth rate preceding the outbreak and neighborhood structure (within a 10 meter radius of the host tree) mediate the effect of tree size, and that the direction and magnitude of these mediating effects vary with tree size. Tree scale mortality probability increased with pre‐outbreak growth rate for small to medium sized host trees (~10–25 cm diameter), but that same effect was not detected for large trees. Conversely, tree scale mortality probability increased with greater neighborhood density, with the most pronounced effects for medium to large sized host trees (~15–30 cm diameter). Within‐stand topographic variability was not an important predictor of mortality probability; among stands, however, the stand in the driest topographic position experienced the greatest overall mortality. By explicitly considering how within‐stand heterogeneity mediates individual tree scale susceptibility to bark beetle outbreak, our findings bridge an important gap in understanding multi‐scale drivers of disturbance dynamics.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Neighborhood context mediates probability of host tree mortality in a severe bark beetle outbreak","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Bark beetle outbreaks structure forests not only directly via mortality of overstory trees but also indirectly by releasing the growth of understory trees as resource availability (i.e., light, water, and nutrient availability) increases for survivors.
