Across the Northern Hemisphere, tree mortality from widespread bark beetle outbreaks raises concerns for how forest management can foster resilience to future outbreaks. Density reduction (i.e., thinning) treatments can increase vigor of remaining trees, but the longevity of treatment efficacy for reducing susceptibility to future disturbance remains a key knowledge gap. Using one of the longest-running replicated experiments in old-growth subalpine forests, we measured stand structure following a recent (early 2000s) severe mountain pine beetle (MPB; *Dendroctonus ponderosae*) outbreak to examine the legacy of historical (1940s) thinning treatments on two components of resilience. We asked: how did historical thinning intensity affect (1) tree-scale survival probability and stand-scale survival proportion (collectively “resistance” to outbreak) for susceptible trees (lodgepole pine [*Pinus contorta*] ≥ 12 cm diameter) and (2) post-outbreak stand successional trajectories? Overall outbreak severity was high (MPB killed 59% of susceptible individuals and 78% of susceptible basal area), and historical thinning had little effect on tree- and stand-scale resistance. Tree-scale survival probability decreased sharply with increasing tree diameter and did not differ from the control (uncut stands) in the historical thinning treatments. Stand-scale proportion of surviving susceptible trees and basal area did not differ from the control in historically thinned stands, except for treatments that removed nearly all susceptible trees, in which survival proportion approximately doubled. Despite limited effects on resistance to MPB outbreak, the legacy of historical treatments shifted dominance from large- to small-diameter lodgepole pine by the time of outbreak, resulting in historically thinned stands with ~2x greater post-outbreak live basal area than control stands. MPB-driven mortality of large-diameter lodgepole pine in control stands and density-dependent mortality of small-diameter trees in historically thinned stands led to convergence in post-outbreak live-tree stand structure. One exception was the heaviest historical thinning treatments (59–77% basal area removed), where sapling dominance of shade-tolerant, unsusceptible conifers was lower than control stands. After six decades, thinning treatments have minimal effect on resistance to bark beetle outbreaks, but leave persistent legacies in shaping post-outbreak successional trajectories.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Does the legacy of historical thinning treatments foster resilience to bark beetle outbreaks in subalpine forests?","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"West of the Cascade Crest in Washington and Oregon (\u0026ldquo;western Cascadia\u0026rdquo;), wildfire has historically been infrequent yet severe, occurring at intervals ranging from one to several centuries, with fire events possibly as large as one million hectares characterized by high levels of tree mortality. As climate continues to warm, some of the largest increases in area burned are expected to occur in regions such as western Cascadia, where fire activity has historically been limited by cool, wet climate. Post-fire management strategies, such as replanting, can reduce the negative impacts of fire on forest ecosystems in this region. Developing post-fire response plans, however, requires an understanding of the spatial patterns of burn severity within fire events, since areas with high levels of tree mortality are where management intervention is often of greatest priority.\nThe objective of this research is to help managers better understand and prepare for wildfire in western Cascadia. Using satellite data dating back to 1984, this project will characterize how spatial patterns of burn severity, and thus fire impacts and forest regeneration needs, vary with the size of fire events in western Cascadia. The results of this research will provide key insights that will help land managers in this region develop strategies for adapting to a warmer, drier future that is likely to bring more frequent fire events.\n","date":1615766400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1615766400,"objectID":"8956aa7bd507f322191d314aab6b454e","permalink":"/project/burn-severity-scaling/","publishdate":"2021-03-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/burn-severity-scaling/","section":"project","summary":"West of the Cascade Crest in Washington and Oregon (\u0026ldquo;western Cascadia\u0026rdquo;), wildfire has historically been infrequent yet severe, occurring at intervals ranging from one to several centuries, with fire events possibly as large as one million hectares characterized by high levels of tree mortality.

Outbreaks of native bark beetles (Curculionidae: Scolytinae) are key natural disturbances that shape the structure and function of conifer forests across the northern hemisphere. While drivers of bark beetle outbreaks have been studied extensively at spatial scales ranging from stands to continents, within‐stand processes governing individual tree mortality in an outbreak are less well understood. Here, we use a spatially explicit long‐term monitoring dataset of a lodgepole pine (*Pinus contorta* var. *latifolia*) forest (9000 individually mapped trees in three 2‐ha plots) impacted by a severe mountain pine beetle (*Dendroctonus ponderosae*) outbreak to explore interactions among fine scale drivers of beetle‐caused tree mortality. Using a Bayesian spatial modeling approach, we evaluated how tree scale and tree neighborhood scale characteristics interact with tree size to mediate host tree susceptibility to mountain pine beetle outbreak in the Southern Rocky Mountains (USA). We found evidence that both tree growth rate preceding the outbreak and neighborhood structure (within a 10 meter radius of the host tree) mediate the effect of tree size, and that the direction and magnitude of these mediating effects vary with tree size. Tree scale mortality probability increased with pre‐outbreak growth rate for small to medium sized host trees (~10–25 cm diameter), but that same effect was not detected for large trees. Conversely, tree scale mortality probability increased with greater neighborhood density, with the most pronounced effects for medium to large sized host trees (~15–30 cm diameter). Within‐stand topographic variability was not an important predictor of mortality probability; among stands, however, the stand in the driest topographic position experienced the greatest overall mortality. By explicitly considering how within‐stand heterogeneity mediates individual tree scale susceptibility to bark beetle outbreak, our findings bridge an important gap in understanding multi‐scale drivers of disturbance dynamics.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Neighborhood context mediates probability of host tree mortality in a severe bark beetle outbreak","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Bark beetle outbreaks structure forests not only directly via mortality of overstory trees but also indirectly by releasing the growth of understory trees as resource availability (i.e., light, water, and nutrient availability) increases for survivors.
