      <title>Burn severity spatial scaling</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;West of the Cascade Crest in Washington and Oregon (&amp;ldquo;western Cascadia&amp;rdquo;), wildfire has historically been infrequent yet severe, occurring at intervals ranging from one to several centuries, with fire events possibly as large as one million hectares characterized by high levels of tree mortality. As climate continues to warm, some of the largest increases in area burned are expected to occur in regions such as western Cascadia, where fire activity has historically been limited by cool, wet climate. Post-fire management strategies, such as replanting, can reduce the negative impacts of fire on forest ecosystems in this region. Developing post-fire response plans, however, requires an understanding of the spatial patterns of burn severity within fire events, since areas with high levels of tree mortality are where management intervention is often of greatest priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objective of this research is to help managers better understand and prepare for wildfire in western Cascadia. Using satellite data dating back to 1984, this project will characterize how spatial patterns of burn severity, and thus fire impacts and forest regeneration needs, vary with the size of fire events in western Cascadia. The results of this research will provide key insights that will help land managers in this region develop strategies for adapting to a warmer, drier future that is likely to bring more frequent fire events.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Biotic disturbance hotspots</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Interactions among disturbance agents are increasingly important to consider as climate warms and disturbance activity changes. Preliminary research has suggested that the occurrence of biotic disturbance &lt;em&gt;hotspots&lt;/em&gt; (i.e., areas where disturbances from two or more biotic agents are co-occurring in space and time) may be increasing in the western United States in recent years. An increase in biotic disturbance hotspots would have important implications for the resilience of forests in the face of climate change, particularly if disturbance agents have compound or synergistic effects. However, an exploration of the broad-scale factors associated with these hotspots (e.g., climate, weather, vegetation structure, topography) has not been conducted to date. This project will build on research that is already underway by my advisor (Dr. Brian J. Harvey) and our collaborators, who are evaluating whether increases in area of biotic disturbance hotspots are greater than expected from random chance during a period of increasing overall biotic disturbances.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Growth releases following bark beetle outbreak</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bark beetle outbreaks structure forests not only directly via mortality of overstory trees but also indirectly by releasing the growth of understory trees as resource availability (i.e., light, water, and nutrient availability) increases for survivors. This growth release is a &lt;em&gt;compensatory response&lt;/em&gt; of trees adapted to periodic bark beetle outbreaks, preserving ecosystem function. The growth release of trees surviving bark beetle outbreaks has been well documented at the stand scale and has frequently been used to detect the occurrence of past outbreaks. However, the impact of within-stand spatial configuration (e.g., overstory mortality, live tree composition) on surviving tree growth release is less well understood. This project utilized a spatially explicit long-term monitoring dataset of over 9,000 individually measured and mapped trees in the

 to quantify compensatory responses in a spatially explicit framework at different scales.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Host tree mortality from bark beetle outbreak</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While drivers of bark beetle outbreaks have been studied extensively at spatial scales ranging from stands to continents, within-stand processes governing individual tree mortality in an outbreak are less well understood. Here we used a spatially explicit long-term monitoring dataset of over 9,000 individually measured and mapped trees in the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fs.usda.gov/rmrs/experimental-forests-and-ranges/fraser-experimental-forest&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Fraser Experimental Forest&lt;/a&gt;
 (CO, USA) to explore interactions among fine scale drivers of beetle-caused tree mortality. Using a Bayesian spatial modeling approach, we evaluated how tree scale and tree neighborhood scale characteristics interact with tree size to mediate host tree susceptibility to mountain pine beetle outbreak in the Southern Rocky Mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I completed this project as part of my Master&amp;rsquo;s thesis, entitled &amp;ldquo;Modeling individual lodgepole pine mortality from mountain pine beetle outbreak in a spatially explicit framework&amp;rdquo;, which I defended in November 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
